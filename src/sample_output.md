# AI Feedback Report

## Comment 1
**Feedback:** The variable names are not descriptive enough.  
**Code Snippet:**  
```python
x = 10
y = 20
z = x + y
```  
**Suggestion:** Rename variables `x`, `y`, and `z` to more meaningful names like `apples`, `oranges`, and `total_fruits`.

## Comment 2
**Feedback:** Consider optimizing this loop to reduce time complexity.  
**Code Snippet:**  
```python
for i in range(len(arr)):
    for j in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            print('duplicate')
```  
**Suggestion:** Use a set-based approach to check duplicates instead of nested loops.

## Overall Summary
Great effort! ðŸš€ The code is functional but can be improved with better naming conventions and optimization. Keep refining your coding styleâ€”youâ€™re on the right track!
